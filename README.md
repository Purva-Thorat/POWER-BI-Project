Temporal Trends
Monthly Performance:
Revenue demonstrates relative stability throughout the year with some notable variations. The period from June through August shows peak performance at approximately $1.0-1.1M per month, representing the summer beverage consumption surge. December also performs strongly at $1.1M, likely driven by holiday season demand.

Strategic Recommendations

Seasonal Optimization: Capitalize on the June-August peak period with increased inventory, promotional campaigns, and distribution capacity planning.
Q1 Growth Strategy: Address the lower first-quarter performance ($0.5M monthly) through targeted promotions, new product launches, or seasonal flavor variants.
Geographic Expansion: While coverage is nationwide, identify under-penetrated states for targeted growth initiatives and distribution partnerships.
Product Mix Analysis: Conduct deeper analysis on individual brand performance (Coca-Cola, Sprite, etc.) to optimize inventory allocation and marketing spend.
